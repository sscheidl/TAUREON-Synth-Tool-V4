## Current stage

```text
Stage 0 – Bootstrap, inventory, provenance, architecture verification
Status: PASS / CLOSED
Gate: PASS

Stage 1 – Native transport spikes (WMS + WinMM)
Status: ACTIVE / authorized by User 2026-08-24
Implementation lead: Codex. Mandatory Claude Code review at the Stage 1 gate.

## Current architecture baseline

- clean native C++20 rebuild;
- Qt 6 Widgets;
- CMake;
- Windows 11 x64 primary target;
- direct Windows MIDI Services backend;
- native WinMM compatibility backend;
- one active backend per logical connection;
- device-specific logic above transport;
- generic SysEx byte integrity is a core invariant.

Stage 0 recorded the current WMS C++/WinRT namespace, documented initialization/API-mode route, endpoint/group identity guidance, and SysEx7 helper in `docs/reference/ENVIRONMENT_REPORT.md`.

Stage 1 must establish evidence for:

- exact pinned WMS package/runtime deployment pairing, and acquisition of any build-time SDK input (none present locally);
- unpackaged desktop initialization and API-mode observation entry points;
- timestamp normalization;
- WMS maximum transmission constraints and actual SysEx7 callback sequences;
- WinMM persistent identity and `MIDIHDR` lifecycle;
- Qt/WMS initialization/lifetime interaction.

## Governance

- User: Product Owner, Hardware Tester, final decision authority.
- ChatGPT Classic: Project Manager / Supervisor / Context Keeper.
- Codex: Implementation Lead.
- Claude Code: Architecture & Review Lead.

## Documentation status

Stage 0 local evidence is now available:

- README
- product vision
- architecture baseline
- development process
- AI collaboration
- quality policy
- GUI design specification
- clickable GUI mockup
- C++20/CMake bootstrap and initial Windows CI workflow
- environment/toolchain report
- legacy inventory
- provenance record
- Stage 0 report

Earlier TAUREON2 planning documents are reference sources, not active specifications.

## Current blockers

No unresolved Stage 0 blocker remains. The mandatory Claude Code re-review concluded **PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UPS**; no P0/P1 finding remains.

## Stage 0 evidence correction (2026-08-24)

The recorded WMS integration route was re-derived from the installed `Microsoft.Windows.Devices.Midi2.winmd`.
The earlier entry named a wrong namespace root and three identifiers that do not exist in the SDK. The
Stage 0 report's review record was also corrected: the reviewer's verdict was HOLD with two P1 findings, not
the "PASS WITH NON-BLOCKING FOLLOW-UPS" that had been entered. Stage 0 closure per D-012 stands; only the
evidence and the review record changed. Details in [`STAGE_0_REPORT.md`](../stages/STAGE_0_REPORT.md).

## Exact next action

Codex executes Stage 1 per [`STAGE_1_BRIEF.md`](../stages/STAGE_1_BRIEF.md), starting with acquisition of the
pinned WMS SDK package — no client code before that package exists locally. Stage 1 ends with
`STAGE_1_REPORT.md` and the mandatory Claude Code gate review. Do not begin Stage 2.

## Hardware validation

Not started for V4.

Previous hardware evidence belongs to the legacy/reference inventory until explicitly migrated as fixture/evidence.
